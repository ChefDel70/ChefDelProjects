Josh's game 'baristawarrior' is a take on being an employee at starbucks. There is a list of drinks that can be ordered. The program outputs the total in $ and then asks user input for the barista to write the name on the drink. Sometimes there is output from the employee on how he's feeling. The game goes through severeal iterations to before the game ends and output all the drinks that were ordered by several customers.
